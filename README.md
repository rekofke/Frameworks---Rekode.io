# Frameworks - Favorite Website Project

This is a project assignment for Coding Temple. The assignment is to re-create our favorite website or to create one of our own design.
I elected to create a model for my personal company website "Rekode Advanced Development." This site has a home, event, about, location and contact page all linked via navbar. It is created with HTML and styled using CSS and BootStrap, Additionally there is a seperate JavaScript (scripts.js) file for interactive design ideas that I may implement in the future.  I hope you enjoy it!
