# Frameworks & Intro to JavaScript | (Project) Recreate Your Favorite Website  (Live Event Code)

This code was written during the live event covering the Frameworks & Intro to JS project "Recreate Your Favorite Website"
You may use this code as a starting point for your project if you wish. You can either clone the repository or download the .zip

In 'js/scripts.js' are a few small examples of very basic JavaScript functions. Two of which are bound to a button created in 'index.html'
One is bound to the onmouseenter event, the other is bound to onmouseexit. One is not bound to anything at all and can be ran via Node.js or the Console in the inspector / dev tools in your browser.
